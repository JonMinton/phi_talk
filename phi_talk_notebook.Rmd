# Introduction 

This document will introduce a couple of concepts, and one R package, for performing statistical inference tests in R.

1. The There-is-only-one-test framework, and the R package infer
2. Bayes Factors, as distinct from Neyman-Pearson Hypothesis Testing frameoworks

# Proposed structure

* TIOOT/Infer
    * There-is-only-one-test : background
        * Null & Alternative Hypothesis
        * Disproving the Null
            * One-sided and two-sided tests
            * Spiegelhalter Definition
                * > P-values are a measure of conflict between data and a hypothesis, and are certainly not direct expressions of a probability of hypotheses.
                     * [Communicating Uncertainty about facts, numbers, and science](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rsos.181870)
    * [Infer package](https://github.com/tidymodels/infer)
        * DataCamp courses
            * [Foundations of Inference](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/foundations-of-inference)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
